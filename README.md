# Vector Library

## What is it?

Vector Library is a small library with some basic mathmatical operators to work with vectors. 

On my journey to programming Artificial Intelligence, I wanted to gain a better understanding of Linear Algebra. This is a small project to deepen my understanding. 

## How do I run it?

### Prerequisits:

You will have to have Vagrant installed and a virtual environment creator like VirtualBox. 

### Steps:

Fork my project, then download it from your GitHub account. The included VagrantFile will make sure your Vagrant is correctly configured when you use "vagrant up" to start up a new virtual machine.

After that you will be able to access the website via "localhost:5000" and click around. 

## Can I contribute?

Feel free to make as many changes as you'd like and share them with me! That way we can both learn from eachothers code!
